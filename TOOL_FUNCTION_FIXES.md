# 🔧 Tool Function Execution Fixes

## Problem Identified:
❌ **Tool functions weren't being called** - the dual-agent system wasn't properly delegating authentication and tool requests to the Execution Agent.

## Root Causes Fixed:

### 1. ❌ **Restrictive Delegation Logic**
**Problem:** `_should_delegate_to_execution_agent()` had limited keywords and missed authentication requests
**Solution:** ✅ Expanded keywords to include:
- Authentication terms: "connect", "authenticate", "auth", "login", "access", "permission"
- Service terms: "gmail", "google", "calendar", "email account"
- General assistance: "help me with", "can you", "need access", "set up"

### 2. ❌ **Missing Authentication Task Type**
**Problem:** Execution Agent didn't have "authentication" as a recognized task type
**Solution:** ✅ Added:
- New task type: `"authentication"`
- New handler method: `_handle_authentication_task()`
- Authentication URL generation for Gmail and Calendar
- Proper auth link formatting

### 3. ❌ **Incomplete Task Analysis**
**Problem:** AI task analysis prompt didn't recognize authentication requests
**Solution:** ✅ Updated analysis prompt to include:
- Task type: `"authentication"`
- Actions: `"connect|authenticate"`
- Parameters: `"service": "gmail|calendar|google"`

## Files Modified:
- ✅ `main_poke_agent.py` - Expanded delegation keywords
- ✅ `execution_agent.py` - Added authentication task handling
- ✅ `execution_agent.py` - Updated task analysis prompt

## Expected Results After Fix:
1. ✅ **"Connect to Gmail"** → Triggers authentication task
2. ✅ **"Help me with email"** → Delegates to execution agent
3. ✅ **"I need access to calendar"** → Generates auth link
4. ✅ **Auth links generated** with proper user_id and tokens
5. ✅ **Tool functions called** for any task-related requests

## Test Cases That Should Now Work:
- "Connect my Gmail" → Auth link generated
- "Help me access my email" → Auth link generated  
- "Set up calendar integration" → Auth link generated
- "Send an email" → Email composition flow
- "Schedule a meeting" → Calendar creation flow

**The dual-agent architecture should now properly route tool requests! 🎯**
