# 🔍 Connect Detection Fix

## Problem:
❌ **"Connect" requests** were returning "I couldn't find anything matching your request"

## Root Cause:
The AI task analysis wasn't reliably detecting "connect" as authentication requests.

## Solution Applied:

### 1. ✅ **Enhanced AI Prompt**
- Added explicit examples of authentication requests
- Clear distinction between auth vs task requests
- Specific guidance for "connect", "authenticate", "login", "access"

### 2. ✅ **Keyword Fallback System**
- If AI misses authentication, keyword detection kicks in
- Looks for: `["connect", "authenticate", "login", "access", "auth"]`
- Plus service keywords: `["gmail", "google", "email", "calendar"]`
- Overrides AI decision when both keyword types present

### 3. ✅ **Robust Error Handling**
- If JSON parsing fails, uses pure keyword detection
- Always determines correct service (gmail/calendar/google)
- High confidence score for keyword matches

## Examples Now Working:

### ✅ **These Should Generate Auth Links:**
- "connect my Gmail" → Authentication task
- "connect to Google" → Authentication task  
- "authenticate my email" → Authentication task
- "I need access to calendar" → Authentication task
- "login to Gmail" → Authentication task

### ✅ **Auth Link Format:**
```
To access your Gmail, please click this authentication link: 
https://web-production-d8e63.up.railway.app/auth-web?token=abc123&user_id=user456
```

## Detection Flow:
```
User Input → AI Analysis → Keyword Fallback → Authentication Handler → Auth Link
```

## Files Modified:
- ✅ `execution_agent.py` - Enhanced `_analyze_task()` method
- ✅ `execution_agent.py` - Added keyword fallback detection
- ✅ `execution_agent.py` - Improved error handling

**Now "connect" requests should reliably generate authentication links! 🎯**
